Flexbox is a modern CSS layout model designed to help you **build responsive, space-aware,
and dynamically aligned UIs** with ease.

It’s the antidote to the old days of using floats, tables, and margin hacks.

# What is Flexbox?

**Flexbox** (Flexible Box Module) is a **one-dimensional layout system**. This means you can control layout **either horizontally or vertically**—but not both simultaneously (that’s Grid’s job).

It’s perfect for:

- Centering elements (vertically and horizontally)
- Distributing space between items
- Aligning items to start/end/center
- Making layouts adapt to screen sizes

Activate Flexbox by setting `display: flex` on a parent element (the _flex container_).

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
}
```
