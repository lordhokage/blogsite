# React Hooks Explained

React Hooks revolutionized functional components when they were introduced in React 16.8. Let's explore the fundamental hooks:

## useState: Managing State

```javascript
import { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Clicked {count} times</button>
  );
}
```
